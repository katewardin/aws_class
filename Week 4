Elastic load balancer - 
Monitors health of instances and routes requests to healthy instance (provides single endpoint for external users and redirects incoming requests to instance)

2 Types of ELB algorithm: 
- Round robin (next server in line) 
- Least outstanding requests from HTTP/HTTPS (monitors how many web requests are going to specific server - route new requests to server with least requests) 

ELB benefits 
- scale app perf
- automatically handle failed instances
- protect against failure of an entire availability zone

- Use EC2 
- Priced at hourly basis
- Sticky sessions (bind a user's session to a speciic instance) 
- SSL termination 
- Internal load balancing
